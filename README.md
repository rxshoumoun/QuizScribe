As an application of Natural Language Processing, our project harnesses the power of summarization using T5 extractive text summarizer to create a concise and cohesive summary of given text input; while generating sample question-answer pairs for more practical understanding and testing. The whole process uses T5 transformers and displays output on web app using Gradio.
